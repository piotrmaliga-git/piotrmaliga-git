## About me

I am a student of the third year of Information Technology (specialization in IT System Administration) at Pedagogical University of Cracow. I'm looking for my first job as a Junior Front-end Developer. I am constantly trying to develop in this direction and learn new technologies and tools. I have done a few projects so far which you can see in my repositories on my GitHub account.
